# Mercor Tooling Airtable Exercise

## üìå Project Overview
This project is a **mini-interview task** for Mercor, designed to demonstrate skills in Airtable schema design, Python automation, JSON data handling, and LLM integration.

The goal is to build a complete pipeline that:
1. Collects contractor application data using **multi-table forms** in Airtable.
2. Compresses normalized data into a **single JSON object** stored in the Applicants table.
3. Decompresses JSON back into normalized child tables when needed.
4. Automatically shortlists promising candidates based on **multi-factor rules**.
5. Uses an **LLM endpoint** (e.g., OpenAI GPT) to evaluate, enrich, and sanity-check applications.

## üóÇÔ∏è Airtable Base Setup

The Airtable base consists of **five tables**:

### 1. Applicants (Parent)
- `Applicant ID` (Primary field, Autonumber)
- `Compressed JSON` (Long text)
- `Shortlist Status` (Single select: Pending, Shortlisted, Rejected)
- `LLM Summary` (Long text)
- `LLM Score` (Number)
- `LLM Follow-Ups` (Long text)

### 2. Personal Details (One-to-One with Applicants)
- `Applicant ID` (Link to Applicants)
- `Full Name`
- `Email`
- `Location`
- `LinkedIn`

### 3. Work Experience (One-to-Many with Applicants)
- `Applicant ID` (Link to Applicants)
- `Company`
- `Title`
- `Start Date`
- `End Date`
- `Technologies` (Multiple select)

### 4. Salary Preferences (One-to-One with Applicants)
- `Applicant ID` (Link to Applicants)
- `Preferred Rate`
- `Minimum Rate`
- `Currency`
- `Availability (hrs/wk)`

### 5. Shortlisted Leads (Helper Table)
- `Applicant ID` (Link to Applicants)
- `Compressed JSON` (Long text)
- `Score Reason` (Long text)
- `Created At` (Created time, auto)

## üìù User Input Flow

Since Airtable forms cannot write to multiple tables simultaneously:
- **Form 1:** Personal Details  
- **Form 2:** Work Experience  
- **Form 3:** Salary Preferences  

Each form requires `Applicant ID` and applicants must submit all three forms.

## üêç Python Automations

### Step 3: JSON Compression (`compress.py`)
- Fetches data from child tables.
- Builds a single JSON object per applicant.
- Writes it into `Applicants ‚Üí Compressed JSON`.

### Step 4: JSON Decompression (`decompress.py`)
- Reads JSON from Applicants.
- Restores/upserts records into child tables.

### Step 5: Shortlist Automation (`shortlist.py`)
Rules for shortlisting:
- Experience ‚â• 4 years OR worked at a Tier-1 company (Google, Meta, OpenAI, etc.).
- Preferred Rate ‚â§ $100/hr AND Availability ‚â• 20 hrs/week.
- Location in {US, Canada, UK, Germany, India}.

If criteria met ‚Üí Create entry in `Shortlisted Leads`.

### Step 6: LLM Evaluation (`llm_eval.py`)
- Triggered when `Compressed JSON` is updated.
- Calls an LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4o-mini).
- Produces:
  - `LLM Summary` (‚â§ 75 words)
  - `LLM Score` (1‚Äì10)
  - `LLM Follow-Ups` (questions for clarification)

### Step 7: Combined Runner (`main.py`)
Runs the entire pipeline:
1. Compression  
2. Shortlisting  
3. LLM Evaluation  

```bash
python main.py
```
